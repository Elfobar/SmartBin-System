# SmartBin+


## Suggestions for a good README


Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.


## Description


SmartBin+ is a one-of-a-kind system for efficient waste monitoring that will surely change your life for good! With nothing less than a set of precise sensors and a high quality software, you will be able to transform a simple trash can into a masterpiece of high-end technology. Look into the future, the days where the current status of each bin equipped with our system can be easily checked through an application. There you will be able not only to see the level of fullness of the container, but also the humidity degree which allows you to judge when the waste needs to be removed. Of course, the bin could not be classified as a SmartBin+ unless we carefully implement a notification feature that will help you to be on time even if you don’t check your devices often. Moreover, the system can be well-integrated into the public space as it shows the status of the bin on the display and the level of fullness can also be determined by LED light indicators. The sound will remind you when it’s time to empty the SmartBin+. Important to mention is that the system will help to ensure fire safety by alarming you in case of a presence of flame in the container!
