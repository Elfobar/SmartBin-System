## Description

**SmartBin+ is an intelligent waste monitor system designed to optimize waste management at fastfood restaurants. Reliable container fullness and humidity monitor, configurable location, promptly notification feature and fire detection capabilities: all-in-one!**

Are you prepared to transform the way your restaurant handles waste? With nothing less than a set of precise sensors and a high quality desktop application, you will gain insights into your disposal stations' organization, keeping you informed about all container statuses. Within the application, you will not only have access to the current level of fullness of the bins, but also the humidity degrees which allow you to judge when the garbage needs to be removed. Of course, the bin system could not be classified as a SmartBin+ unless we carefully implement a notification feature that will help to rationalize waste management. Furthermore, our system enhances the quality of restaurant service by utilizing display status indicators and LED lights, benefiting both garbage collectors and restaurant clients. Last but not least, the system will help to ensure fire safety by alarming you in case of a presence of flame in the container!
